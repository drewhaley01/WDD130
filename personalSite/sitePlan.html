        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The homepage will be an introduction to Pokémon as a whole. It will focus mostly on the games and how they have changed over the years with style and gameplay. There will be a video that will play the original Pokémon theme song from the anime as it aired in 1996. Under that there will be photos of the first 3 games, Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow. Further down the page there will be one large image that houses the art for the other games that have come out since the first games release 26 years ago. Along the side of the page on the left there will be some basic info for each of the generations of games I-IIIV. This will include the region, main antagonists, starters, and year of release.      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Pokemon Information</h3>
      <p>
        The first subpage will be a display of a few Pokémon that I have chosen from Generation 1. I will only have 15 out of the original 151 because to do all of them would be rather excessive for this assignment. Along with the pictures of the Pokémon I am planning on having a shadow box around the Pokémon that displays the typing of that particular Pokémon by differing colors. I will also have a basic move set displayed with the Pokémon so that if anyone wants to use that Pokémon, they can have the best info available. The attacks that I will be displaying are going to be for the best competitive battling. There is a lot of people who prefer to play competitive Pokémon or add challenges to the Pokémon games, so this is going to be the best option to cover all of the bases.       </p>

      <h3>Pokemon Typing and Battles</h3>
      <p>
        The second subpage will all about Pokémon typing and advantages and disadvantages. It will show how some types of Pokémon are strong against others and some moves are strong against other type of Pokémon. I have chosen several different types of Pokémon when I chose what 15 I was going to be using. It will also explain how some attacks are “physical” and some are “special”. Within Pokémon games there are different types of attacks and depending on each Pokémon’s individual stats those attacks might differ. Some Pokémon have a higher “physical” attack, and some might have a higher “special” attack. I will also explain how when a move matches up with a Pokémon’s type the move gets an extra boost of power. It is called S.T.A.B. (Same Type Attack Bonus). It adds 1.5x attack damage to the move simply because it is the same typing as the Pokémon.       </p>
